<strong>BlackCaps white-ball captain Kane Williamson</strong>  has returned to the nets in a positive sign he could return from a knee injury to make the Cricket World Cup in October and November. The 32-year-old suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament while fielding in an Indian Premier League match in April.


Williamson posted a video on Instagram with the caption: “Nice to be back in the nets with the bat in hand for a few throws.”

                He was carried from the field in the opening game for the Gujarat Titans on April 2. Williamson had successful surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee in late April before beginning rehabilitation.

                <br>
                Williamson was one of the stars at the last ODI World Cup in 2019, named player of the tournament after scoring two hundreds at an average of 82.57.

Last month Black Caps coach Gary Stead said there was still a chance of Williamson making the tournament after initial thoughts it appeared slim.
